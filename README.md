# Advent of Code

I have been participating in Advent of Code for several years now, although I typically get distracted after a couple of weeks due to work and family obligations. In 2018 and 2020, I used Go to solve the puzzles, while in 2023, I opted for a Python notebook.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year having its own directory. Inside each year's directory, you will find the solutions to the daily puzzles, along with any necessary input files or additional resources.
